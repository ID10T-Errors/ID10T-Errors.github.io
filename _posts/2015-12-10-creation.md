Thanks to [zebMcCorkle's](https://github.com/zebMcCorkle) efforts with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the ID10T Errors now have a blog!

We will be making posts about each competition we compete in, as well as the various projects we are working on!

Our GitHub repository for all writeups, files, scripts, etc. can be found [here](https://github.com/ztaylor54/ctf), and we will also publish all of our writeups to this website as we finish competitions.

We look forward to sharing some great content with you!
