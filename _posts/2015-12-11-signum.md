[Zeb](https://github.com/zebMcCorkle) and I have begun work on a new project, [Signum Workshop](https://github.com/ID10T-Errors/signum-workshop-client).

Signum Workshop is a web UI that will enable computer science teachers to write and maintain their own programming problems for their students to solve. Students will use an implementation of [Code-Editor](http://ztaylor54.github.io/code-editor/#base16-dark) to work on problems, which will then be submitted to a server to be run and checked against teacher-defined test cases.

It is currently under heavy development, and we should have a working prototype very soon.

A development version (most likely broken) is available at [ctftoolkit.com/signum-workshop-client](/signum-workshop-client).
