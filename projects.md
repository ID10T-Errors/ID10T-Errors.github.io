####[CTF-Toolkit](https://github.com/ztaylor54/CTF-Toolkit)
This work-in-progress is a toolkit which will contain many ciphers and algorithms commonly seen in the first few problems of most [CTF](https://ctftime.org/)s.  

We are programming it in `Java`, using the [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) build engine and [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration). Our test coverage status is provided by [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/).  


####[Code-Editor](https://github.com/ztaylor54/code-editor)
Code-Editor is a beautiful in-browser programming tool created using [Code-Mirror](https://codemirror.net/). It has different themes, can perform syntax-highlighting on more than 100 languages, and it can be found here: [Code-Editor](http://ztaylor54.github.io/code-editor/#base16-dark).  

####[Signum Workshop](https://github.com/ID10T-Errors/signum-workshop-client)
Signum Workshop is a hands-on programming client designed for the Computer Science I class at Brenham High School. Currently a work-in-progress, it will soon be hosted on this website allowing students to solve basic `Java` programming problems and send them to a server, where they will be compiled and run against custom test-cases.  

A **very**, ***very*** broken development version* of this project is available at [ctftoolkit.com/signum-workshop-client](http://www.ctftoolkit.com/signum-workshop-client).  

*Most of the development to-date has been on the back-end, so the web UI is very primitive.
