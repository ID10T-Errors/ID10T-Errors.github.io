#Who are the `ID10T Errors`?
We are a CTF based in Texas, consisting of high school students who are also aspiring computer scientists! I've created this page to give each team member a chance to tell you a little about themselves. Feel free to send us an email at [admin@ctftoolkit.com](mailto:admin@ctftoolkit.com) if you have any questions, or would like us to help with a project!
